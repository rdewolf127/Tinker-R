85213,3/2/2018,Carmenère,8,2,47,32,US,"Chuck Reininger sources the fruit for this wine from what is arguably the best site in the Walla Walla Valley. The wine does not shy away from the herbal aspect for which Carmenère is known, but the stemminess is mitigated thanks to the influence of new French oak.

619,1/1/2018,Riesling,31,3,25,26,Germany,"Ripe, juicy peaches and nectarines burst from the nose and palate of this semisweet Riesling. Sunny and pristine, with a soft, lacy sweetness, it's balanced by bristling acidity and a delicate minerality on the finish.",Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese,91,Mosel,17,,,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler
79278,2/28/2018,Riesling,31,3,10,26,Germany,"Plump, creamy and off dry, this is Riesling that's easy and approachable, with bright lime sherbet and green apple notes. Drink now.",,85,Mosel,17,,,Starling Castle
70655,2/21/2018,Riesling,31,3,43,26,Germany,"The ‘goldkap,' or ‘gold capsule,' in this wine's designation indicates a riper cuvée than the producer's ordinary spätlese. As expected, the fruit is exuberant and lush with hints of tinned apricots and peach jam. An underlying note of lemon zest enlivens the palate and carries over to the long, flowery finish. There's lots of sweetness here; consider serving on its own.",Hallgartener Jongfer Spätlese Goldkap,91,Rheingau,25,,,Prinz
126854,3/28/2018,Rosé,32,2,24.5,18.25,France,"Prototypical Provence rosé, hinting at melon and peach but remaining very fresh and minerally at the same time, finishing dry and even a bit dusty, with strong overtones of citrus. Drink now.",,87,Provence,24,Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire,,Château Coussin
38364,1/21/2018,Rosé,32,2,12,18.25,Portugal,A strange orange-pink color for a wine that is somewhere between fruity and sweet and acid and bitter. This one hasn't found a balance.,Companhia das Lezírias Herdade de Catapereiro,82,Tejo,28,,,Wines & Winemakers
87970,3/6/2018,Sangiovese,33,3,24,64.25,US,"Tastes like a good, ripe Zinfandel, with red cherry, raspberry and licorice flavors as well as lots of pepper, cinnamon, anise and cloves. High alcohol gives it a hot feel. Drink now.",Stolpman Vineyard,86,California,6,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,Santa Barbara Winery
45766,1/31/2018,Sangiovese,33,3,19,64.25,Italy,Rosso di Montepulciano (in this case Sangiovese is blended with 20% Merlot and aged in oak barrique) is a great wine to serve with pasta or easy meat dishes. The wine's natural acidity cuts through the fat in those dishes and leaves loads of wild berry on the fade.,,87,Tuscany,29,Rosso di Montepulciano,,Poliziano
97681,3/14/2018,Sangiovese,33,3,169,64.25,Italy,". There's a compact, traditional characteristic here that gives this wine smooth, sophisticated appeal.

139506,4/2/2018,Sangiovese,33,3,45,64.25,Italy,"A dark wine with purplish pigmentation, excellent concentration and inten sity. Has cherry, leather and loads of toasted notes that do not overwhelm. Smooth, silky and spicy in the mouth, this textbook Brunello is almost too much of a good thing. Imported by Verdoni Imports.",,92,Tuscany,29,Brunello di Montalcino,,Corte Pavone
59357,2/10/2018,Sangiovese Grosso,34,1,30,30,Italy,"Vintner Gianni Pignattai has crafted a gorgeous Rosso di Montalcino that is a small step away in intensity and complexity from its big brother Brunello. Careful oak aging adds layers of spice and tobacco, but there's also an abundance of bright berry fruit. The wine is lean and compact in the mouth with a fresh close.",,90,Tuscany,29,Rosso di Montalcino,,Pietroso
8369,1/8/2018,Sauvignon Blanc,35,2,25,21,US,"Selected from the Ritchie Vineyard, this expressive white offers lychee and lemongrass, plus exotic back currents of spice that playfully interject themselves throughout the fruit. Refreshing in acidity the wine veers into tart grapefruit and lemon before settling on satisfying white peach.",Russian River Selection,88,California,6,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Gary Farrell
8985,1/9/2018,Sauvignon Blanc,35,2,17,21,US,"A stunning squeeze of fresh tangerine enlivens both the aroma and palate of this crisp wine that's high in acidity and dancing in refreshing tangents of lemongrass, kiwi and pineapple.

62646,2/15/2018,Shiraz,36,2,10,46.5,Italy,"Here's a dense Shiraz from Lazio with aromas of mature blackberry, blueberry, cherry cola and root beer. The wine is soft and thick in the mouth with a chewy texture and offers loads of raw fruit flavors.",,85,Central Italy,7,Lazio,,Casale del Giglio
57427,2/9/2018,Shiraz,36,2,83,46.5,Australia,"Despite a tough vintage, this is a lush, complete wine. Vanilla and cedar notes on the nose serve to accent the layers of intense—verging on syrupy—blackberry fruit. It's easy enough to drink now, but rich enough that you may want to hold it another couple of years. Just don't expect this one to age more than a decade.",Command,93,South Australia,26,Barossa,,Elderton
42201,1/26/2018,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,37,1,15,15,Australia,This blend of 66% Shiraz and 34% Cabernet Sauvignon has an appealing green pepper edge that provides a lift to the intense berry and toast notes that float on a soft carpet of tannins. Solid length and definition. Drink now or hold a few years for more complexity.,Red Bucket,87,South Australia,26,South Australia,,Longview
135311,4/1/2018,Sparkling Blend,38,1,18,18,Spain,"Apple and peach define the bouquet, but where's the pop? This cava seems a touch quiet and reticent. It's drying, with flavors of apple, white corn and soda cracker. But the bead is weak and the overall personality is shy.

22522,1/14/2018,Syrah,39,5,55,37,US,"Made from Carneros-grown grapes, this Syrah strikes the palate as rather candied in blackberries and cherries. It's smooth in the mouth, and the oak brings a pretty layer of smoky cedar.",,89,California,6,Napa Valley,Napa,Cakebread
24913,1/17/2018,Syrah,39,5,30,37,US,"Thick and concentrated, with brambly fruit and caramel from the American oak. The whole package is intense at first, but with air mellows into elegant flavors of red cherry and rich chocolate, and it would make a fine wine next to wintertime stews. Tasted two bottles with some bottle variation.",Tazetta Vineyard,88,California,6,Livermore Valley,Central Coast,Page Mill Winery
47089,2/1/2018,Syrah,39,5,45,37,US,"Awesome. A superior California Syrah, one of the finest of the vintage. Although it's dry, it's massive in blackberry and blueberry pie filling fruit, with interesting complexities of smoked meats, black pepper, minerals from the earth, cola and sandalwood. Just delicious now, and should hold in the bottle over the next six years.",Kobler Family Vineyard,94,California,6,Green Valley,Sonoma,Pax
71480,2/24/2018,Syrah,39,5,25,37,US,"The sources of this Syrah are all very good, including top vineyards from Santa Barbara, Arroyo Seco, Alexander Valley and Lake County.

17192,1/10/2018,Syrah,39,5,30,37,US,"This is just now being released, unblended Yakima Valley Syrah, with tight, almost impenetrably hard red fruits. It's a little too volatile, with lifted scents that include touches of nail polish, and the tannins are tough and chewy. It's a wine that should be decanted for several hours if you want it to show its best.",,85,Washington,32,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Apex
41897,1/24/2018,Tempranillo,40,2,8,21,Spain,"Nice for a standard, no-frills type of Rioja. The cherry and raspberry aromas are sweet and clean, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of ripe cherry, berry, vanilla and cream. Offers good clarity, power and depth given its price point.",Crianza,87,Northern Spain,21,Rioja,,Rivarey
61176,2/13/2018,Tempranillo,40,2,34,21,Spain,"Broad and rubbery, with ripe black fruit and citrus peel on the nose. Good on the tongue, with a solid mouthfeel.

69401,2/20/2018,Tempranillo Blend,41,1,9,9,Spain,"A tough wine to enjoy. The nose has a cheesy top layer, while the base aromas are of bell pepper and lettuce.
